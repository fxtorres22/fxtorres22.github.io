# Personal SMS Testing Program

This page describes the opt-in for Fernando Torres’ personal Azure SMS learning project.  
This is a **non-commercial program** created only for testing and learning purposes.

## 📌 Program Description
I am experimenting with Azure Communication Services to learn how to send SMS programmatically.  
Messages will only be sent to myself and a small group of friends who have **directly consented** to participate.  

### Example Messages
- "Test SMS from my Azure learning project."
- "Hello [Name], this is a sample notification for development testing."
- "Debug: App triggered SMS at [time]."

## ❌ Opt-Out
You may opt out at any time by notifying me.  
Once you opt out, your number will be removed immediately and no further SMS will be sent.
